# MaiQR Professional Network Concept

## Core Value Proposition
"Your professional identity, verified through your domain, powered by Nostr"

## Key Differentiators from LinkedIn

### 1. Domain-Based Trust
- Every profile is tied to a verified domain
- Businesses use their actual website domains (e.g., doctor.hospital.com)
- Professionals can use personal domains or maiqr.bio subdomains
- DNS verification provides stronger proof of association than email

### 2. Decentralized Identity (Nostr)
- Professionals own their identity (npub)
- No central authority controlling connections
- Data portability across platforms
- Cryptographic verification of credentials

### 3. Direct Value Exchange
- Built-in Lightning payments for services
- Direct appointment booking
- Product/service listings
- No platform fees or intermediaries
