# Proof of Performance Network: A Human-Powered Blockchain

## Vision
Transform athletic achievement and spectator engagement into verifiable value through a decentralized network that:
- Bootstraps athletic careers
- Rewards spectator attention
- Creates verifiable performance history
- Enables direct value transfer
- Builds permanent proof of achievement

## Core Components

### 1. Athletic Performance Layer
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Local Competition] --> B[Regional Events]
    B --> C[National Level]
    C --> D[International/Olympic]
    
    A1[Performance Data] --> A
    B1[Witness Network] --> B
    C1[Brand Sponsorship] --> C
    D1[Global Recognition] --> D
```

#### Performance Tracking
- Competition results
- Training metrics
- Achievement milestones
- Skill progression
- Performance analytics

#### Career Progression
- Local competitions
- Regional qualifiers
- National rankings
- International standing
- Olympic pathway

### 2. Social Proof Layer (Nostr)
```javascript
// Performance Event Structure
class PerformanceEvent {
    kind: 1337,  // Custom event type
    content: {
        type: "performance",
        sport: "string",
        metrics: {
            score: number,
            difficulty: number,
            execution: number
        },
        location: {
            coordinates: [lat, long],
            venue: string
        },
        competition: {
            name: string,
            level: "local" | "regional" | "national" | "international"
        }
    },
    tags: [
        ["p", "performer_pubkey"],
        ["witness", "witness_pubkey1"],
        ["witness", "witness_pubkey2"],
        ["e", "related_event"],
        ["t", "sport_type"]
    ]
}
```

#### Witness Network
- Spectator validation
- Peer verification
- Coach attestation
- Judge scoring
- Community consensus

#### Social Engagement
- Fan following
- Performance comments
- Skill ratings
- Achievement celebrations
- Community support

### 3. Value Network (AreteCoin)

#### Direct Value Flows
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Brands] --> B[Athletes]
    C[Spectators] --> B
    B --> D[Coaches/Facilities]
    E[Bettors] --> F[Prize Pools]
    F --> B
```

#### Value Creation Methods
1. **Performance Rewards**
   - Competition prizes
   - Skill achievement bonuses
   - Progress milestones
   - Training completion rewards

2. **Spectator Engagement**
   - Attention rewards
   - Prediction accuracy
   - Witness participation
   - Community contribution

3. **Brand Integration**
   - Sponsored challenges
   - Achievement rewards
   - Performance bonuses
   - Training support

### 4. Oracle Network

#### Validation Types
```javascript
// Validation Structure
class ValidationNode {
    // Performance validation
    async validatePerformance(event) {
        return {
            technicalScore: calculateTechnical(event),
            witnessConsensus: getWitnessAgreement(event),
            difficultyRating: assessDifficulty(event),
            executionScore: scoreExecution(event)
        };
    }

    // Witness credibility
    async validateWitnesses(witnesses) {
        return {
            pastAccuracy: getHistoricalAccuracy(witnesses),
            consensusAlignment: checkConsensusHistory(witnesses),
            stakingHistory: getStakingRecord(witnesses)
        };
    }

    // Value distribution
    async validateValueFlow(transaction) {
        return {
            performanceBased: calculatePerformanceShare(transaction),
            witnessRewards: calculateWitnessRewards(transaction),
            stakingReturns: calculateStakingRewards(transaction)
        };
    }
}
```

#### Consensus Mechanisms
1. **Performance Consensus**
   - Technical validation
   - Witness agreement
   - Peer verification
   - Historical consistency

2. **Value Consensus**
   - Fair distribution
   - Reward calculation
   - Penalty assessment
   - Stake management

### 5. Settlement Layer (Litecoin)

#### Transaction Types
1. **Performance Records**
   - Achievement proofs
   - Competition results
   - Ranking updates
   - Skill certifications

2. **Value Transfers**
   - Competition prizes
   - Spectator rewards
   - Brand payments
   - Training investments

#### Settlement Process
```javascript
// Settlement Structure
class SettlementBatch {
    performances: PerformanceRecord[];
    valueMoves: ValueTransfer[];
    witnesses: WitnessAttestation[];
    oracles: OracleValidation[];
    
    async createOrdinal() {
        return {
            type: "proof_of_performance",
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            records: this.performances,
            value: this.valueMoves,
            proof: await this.generateProof()
        };
    }
